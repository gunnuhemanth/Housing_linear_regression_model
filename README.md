# Housing_linear_regression_model
🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices based on key features such as the number of rooms, age of the property, and area. The notebook walks through the entire machine learning pipeline—from loading data and preprocessing, to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

📌 Project Overview
Dataset: The housing dataset contains various numerical features related to residential properties.

Model Used: Simple Linear Regression from scikit-learn.

Goal: Predict housing prices using a basic yet interpretable regression model.

🧠 Key Steps
Load and explore the dataset.

Split the data into training and test sets.

Train a Linear Regression model.

Evaluate the model using metrics such as R², MAE, and MSE.

Visualize predictions vs. actual values.

📊 Results Summary
The model shows a strong correlation between selected features and target prices.

Most predictions are close to actual values, as visualized in a scatter plot.

Error metrics indicate decent performance for a baseline model.

The project highlights the importance of feature selection and room for improvement using more advanced models.
